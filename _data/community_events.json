The date is now *WEDNESDAY 17th* not Thursday **</p> <p>TALK #1<br/>-----------</p> <p>Technical Writing 101: A Pentester's Perspective</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>This presentation is derived from my experience as an OffSec SME at KPMG. I\u2019ve lead numerous pentest engagements, and when it comes down to doing QA on reports, I notice that a lot of people who are technically gifted are sometimes not able to communicate their amazing findings through a convincing and easy-to understand report that will be presented to people who are less technically inclined.</p> <p>The focus of the talk is that, I hope to be able to help inform others on \u201cgood\u201d vs \u201cbad\u201d writing language, format, and delivery from the offensive security stand point. Target audience is new grads, students, professionals, and pretty much anyone else including those at the executives level who are interested in creating impactful and easy-to-understand reports, as well as reading them and understanding the process of creating a pentest report.</p> <p>Presenter:</p> <p>Ignatius Michael</p> <p>I\u2019m security enthusiast, passionate in all things security specifically within offensive security. Currently serving my second year at KPMG as a penetration tester (mobile, web app, and network). Pretty much a glorified script kiddie with OSCP who is currently enrolled in OSEP.</p> <p>TALK #2<br/>-----------</p> <p>Cybersecurity Through the Eyes of Psychology</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>This presentation takes a look at how social engineering attacks work from a psychology perspective. Many cybersecurity issues are human problems, and human behaviour has been studied for longer than cybersecurity has existed as an industry. By understanding and explaining the drivers behind human behaviour, people and organizations can learn how to better protect themselves from attacks.</p> <p>Presenter:</p> <p>Victoria Granova (ISC2)</p> <p>Victoria is the President of the (ISC)\u00b2 Toronto Chapter board, where she works to create professional education opportunities and connects security groups across the GTA to advance the industry together. In industry, she is a Senior Information Security Consultant at a Big 5 Bank specializing in cybersecurity incident management and governance. Victoria also contributes as an occasional Instructor at York University in the Cybersecurity Certificate Program.</p> "

The rise of JavaScript and mobile applications have sparked an explosion of easily-accessible REST APIs. But does the rise of APIs result in the downfall of security? Why are there so many vulnerabilities and incidents involving APIs? How can you ensure that your APIs are secure?</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>In this session, we use real-world cases to dive into best practices for securing your APIs. We discuss the attack surface of an API, common authorization problems, and best practice techniques to avoid these problems. At the end of this session, you will have an actionable set of guidelines to assess and improve the security of your own APIs.</p> <p>Name and title</p> <p>Dr. Philippe De Ryck</p> <p>Web Security Expert, Founder of Pragmatic Web Security</p> <p>Bio</p> <p>Philippe De Ryck helps developers protect companies through better web security.

Keep reading to learn more...</p> <p>THE TALKS</p> <p>TALK 1 : DISCOUNT PHISH BURN BETTER</p> <p>- Did my e-mail provider detect my malicious intent?</p> <p>- Was there an e-mail gateway that saw my malware?</p> <p>- Did it land in the junk/spam folder?</p> <p>- Has the victim even seen it or read it yet?</p> <p>- Did he/she click the link or did it seem suspicious?</p> <p>- Did the malware download properly?</p> <p>- Was it analysed in a sandbox?</p> <p>- Did the Anti-Virus detect it? What about EDR?</p> <p>- Maybe the SOC is torturing my malware in a lab environment right now?</p> <p>- Maybe it executed fine, but just stopped working due to a bug?</p> <p>- Was the outbound C2 traffic blocked or even worse, detected?</p> <p>Have you ever asked yourself one of the above questions, or just wonder how life is as an attacker seeking to conduct a successful (spear) phishing campaign? \"Discount Phish Burn Better\" is a talk about how an attacker can improve his odds of successfully phishing a victim by reducing the cost of payload/malware development.</p> <p>TALK 2 : USER MODE API HOOKS AND BYPASSES</p> <p>- Can I upload my tools to the compromised workstation without being detected or do I have to stay in-memory?</p> <p>- Will the EDR detect if I use process injection to migrate to e.g. explorer.exe?</p> <p>- Can I dump LSASS and steal NTLM hashes?</p> <p>- Can I backdoor an application, e.g. Citrix Receiver to escalate privileges when another user logs in?</p> <p>\u00a0<br/>On-host security products such as Anti-Virus (AV) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) products aim to have sufficient surveillance of the host to ensure that attackers can't operate without being detected. One of the techniques such products use is known as Win32 API hooking in user mode. However, as the user-mode component of APIs are loaded and owned by the current process, the process itself can inspect, overwrite or simply just not use them and use its own implementation of the API functionality, to avoid messing with the hooks altogether. This talk will give an introduction to Win32 APIs, modules, API hooks and different bypass techniques that may be essential to avoiding detection.</p> <p>WHO CAN PARTICIPATE?<br/>The event is open for everyone - but it is highly technical.</p> <p>Photo: Blake Connally, Unsplash.com</p> "

When done correctly, combining secure defaults and lightweight checks can enable organizations to solve *classes* of vulnerabilities by construction, preventing bug whack-a-mole.</p> <p>In this talk, we\u2019ll present a practical step-by-step methodology for:<br/>Choosing what to focus your AppSec resources on<br/>How to combine secure defaults + lightweight invariant enforcement to eradicate entire vulnerability classes<br/>How to integrate continuous code scanning into your CI/CD processes in a way that\u2019s fast, high signal, and low friction for developers<br/>How to use an open source, lightweight security linting tool to find bugs and anti-patterns specific to your company</p> <p>### Bio###<br/>Clint Gibler (@clintgibler) is the Head of Security Research for r2c, a startup working on giving security tools directly to developers. Previously, Clint was a Research Director at NCC Group, a global security consulting firm, where he helped companies implement security automation and DevSecOps best practices as well as performed penetration tests for companies ranging from large enterprises to new startups.

We are going to cover everything from the Control Plane or the Master Node, starting with the API server, including etcd, RBAC and network policies. Then, we\u2019ll cover the worker nodes, kubelet, audit logs and pods best practices. We'll talk about the CIS Benchmarks for Kubernetes and the default configurations you need to worry about when deploying a new cluster. We'll show how to use RBAC and assign roles and permissions to your cluster users. We'll demonstrate how to enable audit logs for better visibility and later we'll set up some network policies to avoid communication between pods and prevent any lateral movement from attackers.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Magno Logan works as an Information Security Specialist for Trend Micro.

Presenting language will be English again.</p> <p>Happy to welcome Ben and Marius talking about their interesting research with respect to Content Security Policy!</p> <p>TLDR:<br/>======<br/>Title: \"Content Security Policy - The Past, The Present, The Future?\"<br/>Speaker: Ben Stock / Marius Steffens<br/>Location: Online, please check the link the day before<br/>Start: 16th of March 2021, 6:30 pm (CET)<br/>Networking: Stick around afterwards if you like.</p> <p>Abstract :<br/>=========<br/>Content Security Policy has been around for 10 years and still only a fraction of sites on the Web leverage its full potential to mitigate XSS and other flaws. In this talk, we will discuss the evolution of CSP over time and how sites could leverage it to secure against three attacks classes. This is based on our NDSS 2020 paper (<a href=\"https://swag.cispa.saarland/papers/roth2020csp.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://swag.cispa.saarland/papers/roth2020csp.pdf</a>), which sheds light on the usage of CSP on 10,000 sites over a period of six years. In addition, we will discuss how seemingly irrelevant choices when allowing sites can lead to catastrophic consequences for the security of CSP. Finally, we will discuss insights from our most recent study (NDSS 2021, <a href=\"https://swag.cispa.saarland/papers/steffens2021blockparty.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://swag.cispa.saarland/papers/steffens2021blockparty.pdf</a>), which shows that CSP\u2019s success is in large parts blocked by third parties, and cannot be blamed on developers. With this, we\u2019ll give our personal outlook on where CSP can be going from here, and what needs to happen for it to succeed.</p> <p>Bios:<br/>=====<br/>Ben Stock is a Tenure-Track Faculty at the CISPA-Helmholtz Center for Information Security in Saarbr\u00fccken, where he currently supervises four PhD students. In his PhD, Ben focussed on the detection and mitigation of Client-Side Cross-Site Scripting. During his PhD, he worked closely with SAP Research and interned with Microsoft Research. After his PhD, he joined CISPA as a postdoc, focussing on both Web Security as well as Usable Security research. He currently heads the Secure Web Applications Group at CISPA, is a regular speaker at academic and non-academic venues like CCS, USENIX Security, NDSS, Blackhat, and OWASP AppSec.</p> <p>Marius Steffens is a third-year PhD student in the Secure Web Applications Group at the CISPA-Helmholtz Center for Information Security, supervised by Ben Stock. Marius is interested in finding emerging vulnerabilities in client-side Web applications at a large scale, leveraging dynamic program analysis techniques. Besides automatically exploiting sites, he is also interested in understanding the pitfalls associated with deployments of Web security mechanisms, which are currently hampering widespread adoption.</p> <p>How to participate<br/>==================<br/>OWASP Hamburg Meetup members who RSVP'd for the event will see the Google Meet invite URL at the RHS and can join the video conference directly. I'll update the invite URL ~ a day before. Please make sure when joining you are muted by default.</p> <p>Our OWASP \"Stammtisch\"<br/>=========================<br/>Our meeting is about web applications and their (in)security and/or about IT security in general. People come together who care as a hobby or in their job about information security: developers, managers, pentesters and everybody else who's interested. The atmosphere is open and relaxed. Who's coming to sell products or services: Move on, this is not the right place. OWASP is about education and sharing (mostly) technical information.</p> <p>Feel free to forward our meetup URL to your colleagues or friends. They are welcome, too. Participation is free and open -- as the O in OWASP.</p> <p>Cheers, Dirk</p> "

        "description": "<p>The next OWASP Timisoara Chapter Meeting will be online.</p> <p>&gt; Spring sessions - Theme: Security Automation &amp; Intelligence, Code Patters</p> <p>&gt; Schedule:<br/>Introduction, OWASP News &amp; Updates - Catalin Curelaru</p> <p>Surface Security - Security Intelligence Automation Platform - Teofil Cojocariu (Paddy Power Betfair)</p> <p>Detect complex code patterns using semantic grep - Bence Nagy (Semgrep)</p> <p>Time: 18:30 to 20:30</p> <p>&gt;&gt;Abstract - Surface Security:<br/>Our external attack surface is constantly growing, which gives external attackers the opportunity to continuously search for new attack vectors. In order to successfully respond to Security incidents we needed a centralized platform which aggregates all the data about our premises in a single place.</p> <p>Surface Security (Security Intelligence Automation Platform) is an internally built tool which assists our internal Security teams to gain a holistic view about our externally exposed assets. More than that, it facilitates faster incident response based on the information correlated by it. Surface started as a small project in which we tried to close the gaps identified in our security controls. The platform's core is built in Django which is a Python-based open-source framework which has a fast learning curve. Besides Django, we're using technologies like Ansible (automation), Dkron (fault-tolerant jobs), Elasticsearch (Security metrics storage) and Grafana (reporting). During the whole period it gained a lot of traction in our company determining people to contribute to its success by implementing and suggesting new features. We're currently utilizing it for reporting the Security gaps to other areas of key business areas and for Security controls like: monitoring our externally exposed assets, vulnerability management, security incidents, bug bounty reports and penetration testing.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>I'm focused on Application Security Engineering &amp; Penetration Testing combined with CAMS mindset (Culture, Automation, Measurement, Sharing - DevSecOps) and I reported security bugs to Google, Facebook, Uber, Bitdefender, ING Bank, Yahoo or other companies. One of the most interesting thing is that I built a platform \"Surface - Security Intelligence Automation Platform\" which is being used by more than 900 people in Paddy Power Betfair, Flutter and I was the Security SME for a Private Cloud based on OpenStack with environments as code.</p> <p>&gt;&gt;Abstract - Detect complex code patterns using semantic grep<br/>We\u2019ll discuss a program analysis tool we\u2019re developing called Semgrep. It's a multilingual semantic tool for writing security and correctness queries on source code (for Python, Java, Go, C, and JS) with a simple \u201cgrep-like\u201d interface. The original author, Yoann Padioleau, worked on Semgrep\u2019s predecessor, Coccinelle, for Linux kernel refactoring, and later developed Semgrep while at Facebook. He\u2019s now full time with us at r2c. Semgrep is a free open-source program analysis toolkit that finds bugs using custom analysis we\u2019ve written and OSS code checks. Semgrep is ideal for security researchers, product security engineers, and developers who want to find complex code patterns without extensive knowledge of ASTs or advanced program analysis concepts.<br/>For example, find subprocess calls with shell=True in Python using the query:<br/>subprocess.open(..., shell=True)<br/>This will even find snippets like:<br/>import subprocess as s<br/>s.open(f'rm {args}', shell=True)</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Bence Nagy is a software engineer at r2c, working on Semgrep, an open-source syntax-aware code search tool. At r2c, his responsibilities tend towards building various interfaces atop the core semgrep CLI. These include CI integrations, editor extensions, and the semgrep.dev web app. He previously led a developer experience team at Kiwi.com, the Czech Republic\u2019s top startup at the time of its acquisition in 2019. You should totally ask him for video game recommendations after the talk.</p> "

It can be used in malware obfuscation engines which are used to secure digital rights management against hackers, and bypass anti-malware programs. In the real world scenarios, there are some constraints that should be considered during malware obfuscation. Using deep learning can help to select the best samples which are satisfying these constraints. In this presentation, we will show how can we use deep learning techniques to improve the performance of obfuscator engines against malware detection techniques.</p> <p>Talk 2: Adversarial machine learning (AML)<br/>Speakers: Dr. Sorcha Healy Principal Engineer, Lead Data Scientist at McAfee and Dr. Catherine Huang - Principal Engineer and Senior Staff Data Scientist at McAfee</p> <p>In this talk Sorcha and Catherine will review the general attack landscape against ML and ML security providers. Understanding the fundamentals behind what a machine learning model does and how it works in combination with the Mitre Adversarial Matrix can provide some sensible MLOps practices to protect the components of a ML system. We will review adversarial machine learning (AML) use cases and demonstrate McAfee\u2019s applied research in AML in protecting our customers against this hostile landscape.</p> "
